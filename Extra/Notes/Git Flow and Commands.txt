Set up Repository
====================
git init
git add -A
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin git@github.com:5th-Wall-Gaming/z.git
git push -u origin main

Make a new branch
====================
git checkout -b (New Branch Name)
git add -A
git commit -m "<commit message>"
git push origin (New Branch Name)

Merge a branch back into main
====================
git checkout main
git branch
git merge (name you want to be merged into main)
git branch -d ( Branch Name)


Flow is really simple:

1. Pull latest work down onto develop branch
 (git checkout develop)

2. Create feature branch from develop branch
 (git checkout -b [branchname])

3. Do work

4. Commit (Git Status and make sure staged and unstaged is correct. Then git commit -m "[Message]")

5. Push up
 to remote (git push -u origin [Branch name])

4. Create PR from feature branch to develop branch, add Jeremy as reviewer


when you go work on a new feature, you’ll need to check out dev, so do a `git stash save web-config-hackery` then git stash apply when you’re on your new branch
